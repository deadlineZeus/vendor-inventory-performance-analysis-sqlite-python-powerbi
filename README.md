# Vendor Performance Analysis: Optimizing Vendor & Inventory Strategies

<details open>
<summary><strong><span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Executive Summary and Overview</span></strong></summary>
<br>

This project focuses on **optimizing vendor performance and inventory management** to reduce costs, improve supply chain resilience, and enhance profitability.  

Using a combination of **Power BI**, **Python**, and **SQL**, raw CSV data was transformed into a unified vendor performance dataset, enriched with **statistical analysis** and **business intelligence dashboards**. The final output is a set of **actionable strategies** that address vendor dependency, pricing inefficiencies, bulk purchase benefits, and inventory turnover.  

Stakeholders gain access to a **live, interactive Power BI dashboard** enabling them to explore vendor metrics, brand performance, and purchasing trends in real time.
