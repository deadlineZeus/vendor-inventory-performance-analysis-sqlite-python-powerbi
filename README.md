# Vendor Performance Analysis: Optimizing Vendor & Inventory Strategies

<details open>
<summary><strong><span style="font-size: 1.25em;">Executive Summary and Overview</span></strong></summary>

This project focuses on **optimizing vendor performance and inventory management** to reduce costs, improve supply chain resilience, and enhance profitability.  

Using a combination of **Power BI**, **Python**, and **SQL**, raw CSV data was transformed into a unified vendor performance dataset, enriched with **statistical analysis** and **business intelligence dashboards**. The final output is a set of **actionable strategies** that address vendor dependency, pricing inefficiencies, bulk purchase benefits, and inventory turnover.  

Stakeholders gain access to a **live, interactive Power BI dashboard** enabling them to explore vendor metrics, brand performance, and purchasing trends in real time.

<summary id="business-context--objectives"><strong>Business Context & Objectives</strong></summary>

Vendor and inventory performance directly influence **profitability**, **cash flow**, and **supply chain stability**.  

The **core business challenge**:  
> How to **optimize vendor relationships** and **streamline inventory management** for cost reduction and operational efficiency.

**Key Objectives:**
- Identify top- and low-performing vendors.
- Detect pricing inefficiencies and vendor dependency risks.
- Improve inventory turnover and reduce slow-moving stock.
- Validate findings using statistical hypothesis testing.

**Manager Summary:**  
Data was cleaned, standardized, and merged into a single vendor performance dataset for accurate analysis. This dataset powered a **live interactive Power BI dashboard** for real-time vendor and inventory insights.

**Technical Details:**
- **Scripts:**
  1. `ingestion_db.py` ‚Äì Uploads CSV files into SQLite, supports large files, logs ingestion progress/errors.
  2. `get_vendor_summary.py` ‚Äì Runs SQL aggregations, cleans/enriches data, calculates KPIs, uploads summary table to database, logs process.

- **Logging:**
  - `log/logging.log` ‚Üí Tracks CSV ingestion.
  - `log/get_vendor_summary.log` ‚Üí Tracks vendor summary creation & upload.

- **SQL Used:** JOIN, GROUP BY, CTEs, subqueries, filtering.

- **Python (pandas):** New columns, type conversions, lambda/custom functions, missing value handling.

- **Power BI:**
  - Loaded **`vendor_sales_summary`** table from SQLite.
  - Created **calculated tables** for analysis:
    1. **BrandPerformance** ‚Äì AvgProfitMargin, TargetBrands, TotalSales  
    2. **LowTurnoverVendors** ‚Äì AvgStockTurnover, VendorName  
    3. **PurchaseContribution** ‚Äì PurchaseContribution%, TotalPurchaseDollars, VendorName  
  - Added **calculated columns** in DAX for improved filtering and metrics.
  - Built **live dashboard** with filters, slicers, and drill-down capabilities.

<summary id="general-findings"><strong>General Findings</strong></summary>

- Loss-making transactions due to high costs or zero revenue.
- Outliers:  
  - Purchase Price max = 5,681.81 vs mean = 24.39  
  - Freight Cost range = 0.09 to 257,032.07

<summary id="strategic-findings"><strong>Strategic Findings</strong></summary>

- **High-Margin, Low-Sales Brands:** 198 brands show high profitability but low sales volume.  
- **Vendor Dependency:** Top 10 vendors = 65.69% of purchases.  
- **Bulk Purchase Benefits:** 72% lower unit cost for large orders.  
- **Slow-Moving Inventory:** $2.71M tied up in low-turnover stock.  
- **Profit Margin Models:** Low-performing vendors have higher margins but lower sales.  
- **Statistical Validation:** Significant profit margin difference between top & low vendors.

<summary id="recommendations"><strong>Recommendations</strong></summary>

1. Re-evaluate pricing for high-margin, low-sales brands.
2. Optimize slow-moving stock with refined purchasing and clearance promotions.
3. Support low-performing vendors with targeted marketing and expanded distribution.
4. Align bulk purchasing with demand to reduce costs without overstocking.
5. Diversify vendor base to reduce dependency risk.
